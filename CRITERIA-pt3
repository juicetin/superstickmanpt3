* Adding user control for rate at which the character moves
* Ability to lose - crashing into obstacles will result in loss of life
* Ability to win - obstacles should no longer repeat 
	- there should be checkpoins to take you to new levels, and finally win
* Ability to provide score to user
* Powerups - should transform stickman into their four personas each which
  	should provide a possible advantage

PASSING GRADE (50%)
DONE* must compile and run in lab (but may use own laptop)
DONE* preserve previous two stages' functionality
		---Stage3=on in config - otherwise no stage 3 stuff will appear
DONE* appropriate use of a behavioural design pattern
		---used so far - observer
		---still can be used - state
DONE* clear code, meaningful variable/method names, informative commenting and
		documentation
DONE* stickman must have configurable number of lives
		---Lives=X in config
DONE* when stickman intersects with an obstacle they lose a life and restart the
		level
		---Simply change stickmanadapter's coordinates, because:
		---Darren+Scott's awesome code means stickman actually has x-coordinates
		---StickmanAdapter is subject, and lives/score are observers - life lost,
			stickman moved back by screen [set amount]
DONE* score must be displayed, showing how well the player is doing (this could
		be as simple a a timer or as complex as you like)
		---Score class printed on screen - simply a timer

CREDIT (65%)
DONE* user control over the stickman - left and right keys will control
		character, which will then in turn move background/obstacles
	* there must be levels (at least 2) and therefore must be checkpoints that
		you can reach in each level to move you onto the next
	* a memory efficient design
		---Loading levels only as previous ones are completed (only thing that is
			stored are the paths to configs for following levels) - very efficient
			in the sense that a theoretically near-infinite number of levels can
			be stored as there won't be X level objects all generated and stored 
			at the very beginning

DISTINCTION (75%)
	* include power-ups: the power-ups should alternate the stickman between
		its four states. TINY mode should permit you to walk underneath some
		obstacles, LARGE should permit you to jump higher than normal mode, 
		and GIANT mode should make you immune to obstacles - i.e. explode on
		impact
		===STATES FOR THE DIFFERENT STICKMAN SIZES VIA ADAPTER===
			---many different "streams" of states = concurrent state machines
			needed
	* a sensible testing framework for your code
		- testing framework only needs to include stage 3 code

HIGH DISTINCTION (85%)
	* further power-ups
	* infinite levels
		===LOOP THROUGH LEVELS PROVIDED IN CONFIG FOR 'INFINITE' LEVELS
	* a scoreboard that persists between games
		===WRITING TO FILE - RAII ON GAME DESTRUCTION MAYBE 
	* more things with exclamation marks!
