* Adding user control for rate at which the character moves
* Ability to lose - crashing into obstacles will result in loss of life
* Ability to win - obstacles should no longer repeat 
	- there should be checkpoins to take you to new levels, and finally win
* Ability to provide score to user
* Powerups - should transform stickman into their four personas each which
  	should provide a possible advantage

PASSING GRADE (50%)
	* must compile and run in lab (but may use own laptop)
	* preserve previous two stages' functionality
	* appropriate use of a behavioural design pattern
		===STATE PATTERN FOR CHARACTER STATES - MOVING, WALKING JUMPING
		===STATE PATTERN FOR CHARACTER SIZES/RESULTING BENEFITS
	* clear code, meaningful variable/method names, informative commenting and
		documentation
	* stickman must have configurable number of lives
		===ADD VARIABLE TO CONFIG===
		===
	* when stickman intersects with an obstacle they lose a life and restart the
		level
		===YPOS AND DIMENSIONS OF OBSTACLES FIXED. STORE XPOS SINCE LAST
		COLLISION, AND 'RESTORE' THAT VALUE ON COLLISION 
		===SIMILARLY FOR XPOS OF BACKGROUND
		===PERFORM OPERATION IN SPRITE CLASS - AS ALL DRAWABLES INHERIT SPRITE
	* score must be displayed, showing how well the player is doing (this could
		be as simple a a timer or as complex as you like)
		===EXTRA CLASS FOR SCORE AND SCORE DISPLAY?===
			---score component potentials - time elapsed, factor in life loss,
			obstacles passed, obstacles avoided, obstacles destroyed, etc.

CREDIT (65%)
	* user control over the stickman - left and right keys will control
		character, which will then in turn move background/obstacles
	* there must be levels (at least 2) and therefore must be checkpoints that
		you can reach in each level to move you onto the next
	* a memory efficient design

DISTINCTION (75%)
	* include power-ups: the power-ups should alternate the stickman between
		its four states. TINY mode should permit you to walk underneath some
		obstacles, LARGE should permit you to jump higher than normal mode, 
		and GIANT mode should make you immune to obstacles - i.e. explode on
		impact
		===STATES FOR THE DIFFERENT STICKMAN SIZES VIA ADAPTER===
			---many different "streams" of states = concurrent state machines
			needed
	* a sensible testing framework for your code
		- testing framework only needs to include stage 3 code

HIGH DISTINCTION (85%)
	* further power-ups
	* infinite levels
		===LOOP THROUGH LEVELS PROVIDED IN CONFIG FOR 'INFINITE' LEVELS
	* a scoreboard that persists between games
		===WRITING TO FILE - RAII ON GAME DESTRUCTION MAYBE 
	* more things with exclamation marks!
